                    body: `Dear BASTION CORP Team,<br><br>
           As a cybersecurity company, we’re all well aware of the tactics employed by attackers—but it’s important to never grow complacent. Recently, we’ve seen a rise in more targeted and sophisticated phishing, spear phishing, and vishing attempts across the industry. Even the most security-conscious organizations can become vulnerable without constant vigilance.<br><br>
           Here’s a quick reminder of the risks:<br><br>
           <strong>Phishing and Spear Phishing:</strong><br>
           - Phishing emails are becoming harder to spot, often mimicking legitimate communications from trusted contacts.<br>
           - Spear Phishing attacks are laser-focused, targeting specific individuals within our company, often using insider knowledge to appear credible.<br><br>
           <strong>Vishing:</strong><br>
           - Attackers may use phone calls to impersonate familiar voices or companies, attempting to manipulate us into revealing sensitive information.<br><br>
           We encourage everyone to remain sharp and cautious, even with routine communications. Be sure to:<br><br>
           - Verify unusual or unexpected requests through separate communication channels.<br>
           - Report suspicious emails, messages, or calls to the security team immediately.<br>
           - Never click on links or open attachments unless you are certain of the source.<br><br>
           While these threats aren’t new to us, staying proactive is key to preventing even the most subtle attacks from succeeding.<br><br>
           Thank you for your continued commitment to safeguarding our organization.<br><br>

This is Simon, one of the juniors on your dev team and I just wanted to send a quick reminder that we have the client presentation scheduled for this Friday at 10 AM. Could you please send me all the materials you wanted finalized and ready by Thursday afternoon?</p>
            <p>Let me know if you need any more help with the prep or if there’s anything you’d like to go over before the presentation.</p>
            <p>Looking forward to it!</p>
            <p>Best,<br>Simon<br>BASTION CORP</p>

            <p>I wanted to inform you that we’re currently evaluating the team structure as we prepare for the next quarter. Given the ongoing issues with project delivery and your performance, your role is being considered as part of this assessment.</p>
            <p>I suggest we meet later this week to discuss your future with the company and review your progress against the targets set during your last performance review.</p>
            <p>Please coordinate with my assistant to find a time that works.</p>
            <p>Best regards,<br>Susan<br>BASTION CORP</p>
