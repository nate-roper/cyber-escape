                    body: `Dear BASTION CORP Team,<br><br>
           As a cybersecurity company, we’re all well aware of the tactics employed by attackers—but it’s important to never grow complacent. Recently, we’ve seen a rise in more targeted and sophisticated phishing, spear phishing, and vishing attempts across the industry. Even the most security-conscious organizations can become vulnerable without constant vigilance.<br><br>
           Here’s a quick reminder of the risks:<br><br>
           <strong>Phishing and Spear Phishing:</strong><br>
           - Phishing emails are becoming harder to spot, often mimicking legitimate communications from trusted contacts.<br>
           - Spear Phishing attacks are laser-focused, targeting specific individuals within our company, often using insider knowledge to appear credible.<br><br>
           <strong>Vishing:</strong><br>
           - Attackers may use phone calls to impersonate familiar voices or companies, attempting to manipulate us into revealing sensitive information.<br><br>
           We encourage everyone to remain sharp and cautious, even with routine communications. Be sure to:<br><br>
           - Verify unusual or unexpected requests through separate communication channels.<br>
           - Report suspicious emails, messages, or calls to the security team immediately.<br>
           - Never click on links or open attachments unless you are certain of the source.<br><br>
           While these threats aren’t new to us, staying proactive is key to preventing even the most subtle attacks from succeeding.<br><br>
           Thank you for your continued commitment to safeguarding our organization.<br><br>
           Best regards,<br>
