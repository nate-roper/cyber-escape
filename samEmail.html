We’ll need your approval to finalize the purchase order for the additional network switches. Whenever you can, will you let me know if it’s good to go?<br><br>
           Also, could you make sure your team is prepped to assist with the switchover? We’re expecting minimal downtime, but we’ll need all hands on deck.<br><br>
